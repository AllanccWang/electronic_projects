PASS Condition
------------------------------------
[ON State Test]
Collector Voltage (ON): 0.000 V
Result: PASS - Collector is LOW as expected.

[OFF State Test]
Collector Voltage (OFF): 3.300 V
Result: PASS - Collector is HIGH as expected.
------------------------------------



Below cases are to make sure the test can actually detect a failure! A test that always passes is not a useful test.

Method 1: Base Disconnected (Simulate ON State Failure)
How to simulate: Physically disconnect the wire from GPIO25 to the base resistor.
output:
------------------------------------
[ON State Test]
Collector Voltage (ON): 3.300 V
Result: FAIL - Collector voltage not within expected LOW range.

[OFF State Test]
Collector Voltage (OFF): 3.300 V
Result: PASS - Collector is HIGH as expected.
------------------------------------
Why it fails:
Expected behavior: When BASE is driven HIGH, no current flows → transistor remains OFF.
ADC result: Collector voltage stays HIGH (~3.3V).
Code detects: ON state voltage > 0.4V → FAIL



Method 2: Collector Forced to GND (Simulate OFF State Failure)
How to simulate: Connect a jumper wire from collector (Pin 1) directly to GND.
output:
------------------------------------
[ON State Test]
Collector Voltage (ON): 0.000 V
Result: PASS - Collector is LOW as expected.

[OFF State Test]
Collector Voltage (OFF): 0.000 V
Result: FAIL - Collector voltage not within expected HIGH range.
------------------------------------
Expected behavior: Even when transistor is OFF, collector is stuck LOW.
ADC result: Collector voltage ~0V during OFF state.
Code detects: OFF state voltage < 3.0V → FAIL



Method 3: Floating Collector (Both States Fail)
How to simulate: Disconnect GPIO34 from the collector.
output:
------------------------------------
[ON State Test]
Collector Voltage (ON): 0.580 V
Result: FAIL - Collector voltage not within expected LOW range.

[OFF State Test]
Collector Voltage (OFF): 0.392 V
Result: FAIL - Collector voltage not within expected HIGH range.

[ON State Test]
Collector Voltage (ON): 0.218 V
Result: PASS - Collector is LOW as expected.

[OFF State Test]
Collector Voltage (OFF): 0.111 V
Result: FAIL - Collector voltage not within expected HIGH range.
------------------------------------
Expected behavior: ADC pin floats, voltage is unpredictable.
ADC result: May read random values due to noise or crosstalk.
- Why ON State Sometimes Passes, Sometimes Fails?
Sometimes the ADC reads 0.000V → interpreted as LOW → PASS.
Sometimes it reads ~0.4–0.5V due to noise, leakage, or internal capacitance → interpreted as not LOW enough → FAIL.
- Why OFF State Always Fails
No pull-up resistor or valid VCC path → collector voltage floats.
ADC reads 0.000V or near-zero → interpreted as LOW → FAIL.
