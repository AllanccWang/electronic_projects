PASS Condition
------------------------------------
Step 1: Testing OFF State (Cutoff)
Action: Driving Base pin LOW to turn transistor OFF.
  -> Expected Collector State: HIGH (1)
  -> Observed Collector State: 1
Result: PASS - Transistor is correctly in cutoff state.

Step 2: Testing ON State (Saturation)
Action: Driving Base pin HIGH to turn transistor ON.
  -> Expected Collector State: LOW (0)
  -> Observed Collector State: 0
Result: PASS - Transistor is correctly in saturation state.
------------------------------------

Below cases are to make sure the test can actually detect a failure! A test that always passes is not a useful test.
Method 1: Force the "ON State" Test to Fail
output:
------------------------------------
Step 1: Testing OFF State (Cutoff)
Action: Driving Base pin LOW to turn transistor OFF.
  -> Expected Collector State: HIGH (1)
  -> Observed Collector State: 1
Result: PASS - Transistor is correctly in cutoff state.

Step 2: Testing ON State (Saturation)
Action: Driving Base pin HIGH to turn transistor ON.
  -> Expected Collector State: LOW (0)
  -> Observed Collector State: 1
Result: FAIL - Transistor is not in saturation state. Collector should be LOW.
------------------------------------
Why it fails:
With the base disconnected, no current can flow from the GPIO pin to turn the transistor on.
When the code drives the BASE_PIN HIGH, the transistor will remain OFF.
As a result, the collector will never be pulled LOW; it will stay HIGH, connected to VCC through the collector resistor.


Method 2: Force the "OFF State" Test to Fail
output:
------------------------------------
Step 1: Testing OFF State (Cutoff)
Action: Driving Base pin LOW to turn transistor OFF.
  -> Expected Collector State: HIGH (1)
  -> Observed Collector State: 0
Result: FAIL - Transistor is not in cutoff state. Collector should be HIGH.

Step 2: Testing ON State (Saturation)
Action: Driving Base pin HIGH to turn transistor ON.
  -> Expected Collector State: LOW (0)
  -> Observed Collector State: 0
Result: PASS - Transistor is correctly in saturation state.
------------------------------------
Why it fails:
This physically holds the collector's voltage at ground potential (LOW).
When the code runs the "OFF State" test, it turns the transistor off, but the jumper wire overrides this and keeps the collector pin at 0V.
The software expects to read a HIGH state but will read LOW instead.
